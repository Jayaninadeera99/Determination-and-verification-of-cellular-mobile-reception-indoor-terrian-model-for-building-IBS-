This project focuses on developing and validating an indoor terrain model to improve cellular mobile reception within the Zenith Building at CINEC Campus. The primary objective is to enhance signal coverage and user experience by accurately modeling the propagation of cellular signals inside the building.

Data collection was conducted using both drive and walk testing methods. The collected measurements were analyzed using MATLAB to develop a terrain model that accounts for factors such as building materials, internal layout, and potential signal obstructions.

The accuracy of the developed model was validated through comparison with real-world signal measurements. Based on the findings, several recommendations were proposed to improve cellular signal reception, including the potential implementation of Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) or repeater systems to enhance overall coverage.
Ultimately, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of indoor cellular signal propagation and provides practical solutions for improving connectivity in complex indoor environments such as the Zenith Building.
(The Zenith Building is a seven-story building constructed with an iron structural framework.)

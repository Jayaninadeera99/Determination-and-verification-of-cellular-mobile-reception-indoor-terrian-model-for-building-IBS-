This project focuses on developing and validating an indoor terrain model to improve cellular mobile reception within the Zenith Building at CINEC Campus. The primary objective is to enhance signal coverage and user experience by accurately modeling the propagation of cellular signals inside the building.

Data collection was conducted using both drive and walk testing methods. The collected measurements were analyzed using MATLAB to develop a terrain model that accounts for factors such as building materials, internal layout, and potential signal obstructions.

The accuracy of the developed model was validated through comparison with real-world signal measurements. Based on the findings, several recommendations were proposed to improve cellular signal reception, including the potential implementation of Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) or repeater systems to enhance overall coverage.
Ultimately, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of indoor cellular signal propagation and provides practical solutions for improving connectivity in complex indoor environments such as the Zenith Building.
(The Zenith Building is a seven-story building constructed with an iron structural framework.)



**Choosing the Repeater System**

After evaluating the various options for improving in-building signal strength, the Repeater System was selected as the most appropriate solution for the Zenith building. Repeaters, also known as signal boosters, work by receiving weak signals from outside the building, amplifying them, and redistributing the strengthened signals inside the building. This system is particularly effective in environments where installing a full DAS is unnecessary due to budget constraints or the limited size of the building.

**Advantages of the Repeater System**

Cost-Effective: Repeaters are more affordable to install and maintain compared to DAS and small cells. This makes them a practical solution for buildings that require moderate improvements in signal strength without the need for a comprehensive network of antennas.

Ease of Installation: Repeater systems are simpler to install than DAS or small cells, requiring minimal infrastructure changes. This makes them ideal for existing buildings where large-scale installations may be disruptive.

Improves Signal Across All Frequencies: Repeaters work with multiple cellular frequencies and operators, ensuring that users on different networks experience improved connectivity.

This task refines the understanding of signal weaknesses within the building after the decision to implement the Repeater System.

Task 6: Develop a system plan for installing  Repeaters based on the data collected, specifying component placement (antennas, cables, repeaters) and signal booster locations for each floor.(location & items selecting for  placement)
Milestone 4: Installation and Data Analysis of Repeater System
Task 7: Install the Repeater System components throughout the seven floors of the Zenith building, following the previously developed plan.

**Novelty of the project**

The novelty of  the project is in its integrated  approach  to addressing the specific  challenges  posed by the zenith buildings construction materials ( steel structure) and combining the implementation of In Building Solutions(Develop unique IBS methord)  for signal strength enhancement  with  a development of a precise indoor terrain  model .

**Limitations of the Study**

High Installation Costs:
The Pico Repeater System could not be physically installed due to the high cost of hardware components and installation, limiting the study to theoretical planning and design.

Limited Access to Simulation Software:
Advanced tools like iBwave could not be used due to licensing restrictions and cost, reducing the accuracy of signal modeling and optimization.

Inability to Conduct Full-Scale Testing:
Without actual system installation, real-world performance testing under varying user loads and conditions was not possible.

Limited Access to Advanced Hardware:
Budget constraints prevented the use of high-end testing equipment, reducing measurement precision during signal testing.

Reliance on Theoretical Models:
The study depends mainly on theoretical analysis; real-world validation is needed to confirm the modelâ€™s practical effectiveness.
